<!--    Since RED chose PASS, this is recorded on the top part of the screen with a PASS in the first RED column,-->
<!--    and the cursor has moved on to the second column, which is BLUE, indicating that it is BLUE's move.-->
<!--    On the bottom part of the screen, the BLUE players are now told that it is their turn to choose,-->
<!--    and are told the choices they can make.-->
<!--    The RED players are told that it is their opponent's turn to choose, and are told the choices that their opponent can make.-->
    <!-- Added -->
    Any decision taken will be recorded and notified in a box on the top part of the screen.
    Since RED chose PASS, this is notified to BLUE as "Your opponent decided to pass".
    Notice also that there is now a Large Pile of {{ large_pile_practice }}
    and a Small Pile of {{ small_pile_practice }}.
